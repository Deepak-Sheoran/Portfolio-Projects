# Portfolio-Projects
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio with Python! This repository serves as a showcase of my data science projects, where I harness the power of Python and its data analysis and machine learning libraries to solve real-world problems.

Inside this repository, you'll find a collection of diverse projects that demonstrate my skills in data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling. Each project comes with detailed Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts, making it easy to dive into the code and understand my approach.

Some highlights of my portfolio projects include:

Cross Sell Strategy Formulation using data science with python: Explore how machine learning can help predict which customer is more likely to accept an insuarce policy based on their past data.

Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data: Analyze sentiment in tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to gain insights into public opinion.

Image Classification with Deep Learning: Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images, showcasing my deep learning skills.

Time Series Forecasting: Utilize time series data to forecast future trends, vital for making informed decisions in various domains.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Dashboards: Develop interactive dashboards using libraries like Plotly and Dash, offering insightful visualizations.

Feel free to explore these projects, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback. I'm constantly updating and expanding my portfolio, so stay tuned for more exciting data science projects in Python!
